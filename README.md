# Homebrew Asterisk [Updated]

This repository is a fork of [leedm777/homebrew-asterisk][ast], with some trivial
modifications made to make the formula work on the latest version of homebrew.

## Installation

See the [original documentation][ast] for details.  The basic install process looks like:

    brew tap flafla2/homebrew-asterisk
    brew install asterisk

If any other issues crop up over the years in this install process please send a PR my way
and I will do my best to integrate it.
